	Our Vision</h5>
<p>
	We tell the stories that if you live in Rockford, it makes you glad that you do. The stories that if you&rsquo;re from Rockford, they make you proud to be. The stories that if you&rsquo;ve never been to Rockford, they make you want to come here.</p>
<h5 class="border">
	Our City</h5>
<p>
	These stories are a response to the national attention Rockford, Illinois received in 2011: from Forbes, #9 Most Dangerous in US; from the Wall Street Journal, #10th Most Dangerous in US; New York Times, Portraits From a Job-Starved City; and Comedy Central&rsquo;s The Daily Show portrayed Rockford as a wasteland littered with chain fast food restaurants.</p>
