<br />
His story goes beyond helping a troubled neighborhood out by turning a lot into a skatepark; he has been a mentor and father figure to a lot of fatherless and lost young skateboarders throughout the years (including myself). I&#39;m glad to be able to tell his story, although it wasn&#39;t easy getting him to talk about himself (he&#39;s as humble as a monk to the extent that our interviews were more filled with philosophizing about skateboarding, learning, teaching, failing, and persistence rather than what he&#39;s accomplished).<br />
I hope his humility, hard work, and acceptance of failure is a tenet you can keep in mind, as I do, when struggling with personal battles both everyday and in the future.&quot;<br />

Breathe. Repeat.</a></h3>

<p>Paul is the type of person that just uplifts all around him by pushing forward with an unstoppable drive. Yet, he is humble. He is not one to seek the spotlight, and thats why this piece was so revealing to those closest to him.</p>

<h3><a href="http://ourcityourstory.com/episode/16/#episode">The Greatest<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot;</a></h3>

<p>Once a year on a late September weekend, you&rsquo;ll find Sam Hiser&mdash;along with over 1,000 of his friends&mdash;eating, drinking, and dodging enemy fire on acres of land at Rockford&rsquo;s Midway Village. Dressed to the hilt in World War II period uniforms, complete with impeccably authentic personal items, the men and women meet to create living history and reenact live-action battle scenarios.</p>

<h6>Episode 15</h6>

<h3><a href="http://ourcityourstory.com/episode/14/#episode">Potato Shak</a></h3>

<p>George Avramopoulos is Pete&#39;s older brother. He is one of the reasons so many people frequent the Potato Shak, because of his mild manner and overall energy for life. He&#39;s the type of guy who wants to shake your hand. Ask how you are, and is happy to see you. What makes this story a unique one, is what happens when polite conversation, turns into reality.</p>
