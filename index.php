<br />
The first step was to find a location. &nbsp;We selected Parthenios,&nbsp;an abandoned diner in downtown Rockford that closed in 2010, and a group of people came to fix it up.<br />
<br />
Then the next part was a call out to local photographers to wander through the streets of the city.&nbsp;So, we put out the call. The purpose was to meet people and find out something about them. The process was to take their photo, capture a quote, and display both that night at a pop-up show inside Parthenios.<br />
<br />
Initially the ask was to photographery friends, however, it became apparant that it should be more inclussive. So, the &nbsp;call was put out to everyone. Citywide. It was promoted through the &quot;Our City, Our Story&quot; facebook page, the Rockford Register Star had an article, even Steve Shannon announced it on his morning show on 97zok. It grew organically.<br />
<br />
This is just a sample of the experience people had that day.<br />
<br />
Thank you to the subjects of the photographers, thank you to the people behind the camera, thank you to the people who showed up at the exhibit.<br />

<p>Eric Neubauer was a friend who I&#39;ve looked up to for a long time. His story goes beyond helping a troubled neighborhood out by turning a lot into a skatepark; he has been a mentor and father figure to a lot of fatherless and lost young skateboarders throughout the years</p>

<p>Paul is the type of person that just uplifts all around him by pushing forward with an unstoppable drive. Yet, he is humble. He is not one to seek the spotlight, and thats why this piece was so revealing to those closest to him.</p>

<p>Once a year on a late September weekend, you&rsquo;ll find Sam Hiser&mdash;along with over 1,000 of his friends&mdash;eating, drinking, and dodging enemy fire on acres of land at Rockford&rsquo;s Midway Village. Dressed to the hilt in World War II period uniforms, complete with impeccably authentic personal items, the men and women meet to create living history and reenact live-action battle scenarios.</p>
