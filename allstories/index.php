                A note on the use of non-breaking spaces to create the nav. This was the best, simplest, and cleanest way to achieve what was comped. What was comped was using true | characters within the Proxima Nova font rather than a CSS border. To keep the | character of the Proxima Nova font and not break from style I had to use &nbsp; to force four spaces before and after each | character.
