<br />
I first met him at the Mass Communication Program down at Rock Valley College. It was a program I went through myself, so I was coming back to see how much the program had changed. Paul didn&#39;t standout just because he was the oldest guy in the room, but, because he was the wisest in the room. He asked questions. He wanted to know more more. Be more informed. Knowing full well that asking the questions were not showing his lack of knowledge, but seizing the moment to learn and grow.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We met later, as he wanted to get more info about filmmaking techniques for a piece he was making. No, the piece was not a zombie movie. It was not an action flick. It was not some escapist piece created &nbsp;for fun&hellip; &nbsp;He wanted to raise the quality of a documentary he was filming to tell the story of two of his students that had lost to heroin addiction, and let people know about the experiences he&#39;s seen with regards to the epidemic.<br />
<br />
Paul Dryden Stalter is an ever curious, loyal, fun, and energizing man.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is his story told by him.</p>

<h3><a href="http://ourcityourstory.com/episode/16/#episode">The Greatest<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot;</a></h3>

<p>Once a year on a late September weekend, you&rsquo;ll find Sam Hiser&mdash;along with over 1,000 of his friends&mdash;eating, drinking, and dodging enemy fire on acres of land at Rockford&rsquo;s Midway Village. Dressed to the hilt in World War II period uniforms, complete with impeccably authentic personal items, the men and women meet to create living history and reenact live-action battle scenarios.</p>

<h3><a href="http://ourcityourstory.com/episode/15/#episode">Opportunity in the Making</a></h3>

<p>It started with a tweet, and now Rockford, IL is partnering with ETSY to help get it back to the roots. Artisan. Hand made. Opportunity in the Making.</p>

<h6>Episode 14</h6>

<h3><a href="http://ourcityourstory.com/episode/14/#episode">Potato Shak</a></h3>

<p>George Avramopoulos is Pete&#39;s older brother. He is one of the reasons so many people frequent the Potato Shak, because of his mild manner and overall energy for life. He&#39;s the type of guy who wants to shake your hand. Ask how you are, and is happy to see you. What makes this story a unique one, is what happens when polite conversation, turns into reality.</p>
