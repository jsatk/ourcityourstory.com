	&ldquo;Did I just really see that?&rdquo;&nbsp;It was the middle of December, and on a snow soaked Sunday afternoon a couple dozen fur covered bikes were sprinting down East State Street. Directly after this mass of bikes was a white truck with orange alert lights blazing, hauling a trailer with Team Fur Bandit on it. For the past two years, this has been a common sight during some of the dreariest of all gray winter days. They say it, and you&#39;ve got to believe it: &ldquo;We&#39;re bandits because we steal your attention.&rdquo; These charity bikes rides were organized by DJ Wilson, and this all started after he and his friend got the idea to decorate their bikes during the RAGBRAI &ldquo;the oldest, longest, largest bicycle tour&rdquo; across Iowa.</p>
<p>
	This is a story that has us look back and discover with DJ, how all the pieces came together. This is Team Fur Bandit.</p>
